# Performance Analysis Report - Simplifi Power Tools Chrome Extension

## Executive Summary

This report identifies 6 key performance inefficiencies in the simplifi-power-tools Chrome extension that could impact user experience and browser performance. The most critical issue involves repeated expensive DOM queries that occur during mutation observations.

## Performance Issues Identified

### 1. 游댮 Critical: Inefficient DOM Query Repetition
**Location**: `src/transactionModel.js:7`
**Impact**: High - Expensive DOM traversals on every mutation
**Description**: The `addCalculators()` method calls `querySelectorAll('[sharedcomponentid="QAmountField"]')` repeatedly without caching results. This expensive DOM query is executed:
- Every time a new transaction dialog is detected
- During DOM mutations when split rows are added/removed
- When recreating calculators after row deletions

**Performance Impact**: Each `querySelectorAll` call traverses the entire DOM subtree, which can be expensive on complex Simplifi pages with many elements.

### 2. 游리 Medium: Memory Leaks in Event Listeners
**Location**: `src/calculator.js:280, 315-317`
**Impact**: Medium - Potential memory accumulation over time
**Description**: Event listeners are attached but cleanup in `destory()` method (line 344-347) only removes some listeners. The following listeners may not be properly cleaned up:
- `blur` event listener on `powerToolCalcInputNode`
- `keydown` event listener on `powerToolCalcInputNode`  
- `input` event listener on `powerToolCalcInputNode`

**Performance Impact**: Accumulating event listeners can cause memory leaks and degraded performance over extended browser sessions.

### 3. 游리 Medium: Unnecessary DOM Cloning Operations
**Location**: `src/calculator.js:282`
**Impact**: Medium - Expensive DOM operations
**Description**: The calculator clones entire DOM containers (`this.simplifiInputContainerNode.cloneNode(true)`) which includes all child elements and their properties. This deep cloning operation is expensive and may include unnecessary elements.

**Performance Impact**: Deep DOM cloning is computationally expensive and creates additional memory overhead.

### 4. 游리 Medium: Regex Pattern Compilation on Every Call
**Location**: `src/calculator.js:56, 96`
**Impact**: Medium - Repeated regex compilation
**Description**: Regular expressions are compiled on every function call:
- `let OperatorKeys = /^[\+\-\/*]$/;` in `ManageRowLines()`
- `let allowedKeysPattern = /^[0-9\+\-\/*.]$/;` in `checkAllowedValues()`

**Performance Impact**: Regex compilation is expensive and should be done once at class initialization.

### 5. 游리 Medium: Inefficient Event Handling Without Debouncing
**Location**: `src/calculator.js:83-87`
**Impact**: Medium - Excessive function calls during rapid input
**Description**: The `inputChangeHandler()` calls three separate methods on every input event without debouncing:
- `ManageRowLines()`
- `manageEnter()`
- `manageTextAreaExpansion()`

**Performance Impact**: Rapid typing can trigger excessive DOM manipulations and calculations.

### 6. 游리 Medium: Webpack Bundle Analyzer Always Enabled
**Location**: `webpack.config.js:37`
**Impact**: Medium - Unnecessary build overhead
**Description**: The `BundleAnalyzerPlugin` is always enabled in the webpack configuration, which adds overhead to every build and may open browser windows unexpectedly.

**Performance Impact**: Slower build times and potential interference with development workflow.

## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### 1. Implement DOM Query Caching (Critical)
Cache `querySelectorAll` results in `TransactionModel` class and invalidate cache when DOM structure changes.

### 2. Fix Event Listener Cleanup (Medium)
Ensure all event listeners are properly removed in the `destory()` method.

### 3. Optimize Regex Patterns (Medium)
Move regex pattern compilation to class initialization or use static patterns.

### 4. Add Input Debouncing (Medium)
Implement debouncing for rapid input events to reduce excessive DOM manipulations.

### 5. Optimize DOM Cloning (Medium)
Use more targeted cloning or create elements programmatically instead of deep cloning.

### 6. Conditional Bundle Analyzer (Low)
Only enable webpack bundle analyzer in development mode or via environment flag.

## Performance Testing Recommendations

1. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during extended use with multiple transaction dialogs
2. **DOM Query Performance**: Measure time spent in `querySelectorAll` calls using browser dev tools
3. **Event Listener Count**: Track event listener accumulation over time
4. **Input Responsiveness**: Test calculator responsiveness during rapid typing

## Implementation Priority

The DOM query caching fix should be implemented first as it addresses the most expensive operation that occurs frequently during normal extension usage. This single optimization can provide significant performance improvements with minimal risk to existing functionality.
